/* This program actually doesn't output anything, not even the simple 'Employee doesn't exist' message
  like in the previous query1employeeSalary one, because as we were expecting multiple records, and thus we did not use an
  if-else statement but a while (res.next() -> thus since there are no SQL statement mistakes
  but no records exist, it just doesn't output anything.
